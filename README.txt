Wildfly-git-install
===================

wildfly-git-install lets you install your customized wildfly-installation on all your computers and servers of your build-pipeline: development workstations, testsystems, ci-servers and production systems. Just setup a central git-repository and change the configuration to your needs and clone it on the other servers.

The system-specific configurations like database url, user and password are externalized to the file system.properties residing in the users home directory. Of course the local system.properties are NOT tracked by git. By using git to manage your installations you get all its  power and benefits your used to:
- easily track changes and nail down configurations differences
- switch back and forth between commits and branches
- experiment with new configurations without regrets

A sample system.properties may look like this:

exampleds.jdbc.url: jdbc:postgresql:example
exampleds.user: wildfly
exampleds.password: wildfly

txn.node.identifier: node-test1
jboss.bind.address: localhost

And you start wildfly like this:

./bin/standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-full.xml -P=$HOME/system.properties

The respective section in standalone-full.xml looks like this:

<datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS" pool-name="ExampleDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
   <connection-url>${exampleds.jdbc.url}</connection-url>
   <driver>postgres</driver>
   <security>
      <user-name>${exampleds.user}</user-name>
      <password>${exampleds.password}</password>
   </security>
   
Local logs and pure runtime files are ignored:
standalone/.gitignore:
data
log
tmp

standalone/configuration/.gitignore:
standalone_xml_history
logging.properties


standalone/deployments/.gitignore:
*.war
*.ear
*.deployed
*.failed

Beyond system.properties
========================

Not all configurations can be handled by system.properties. If you need debugging, you just add the option --debug to your
commandline:

./bin/standalone.sh --debug --server-config=standalone-full.xml -P=$HOME/system.properties

To adjust JVM options like max heapspace -Xmx just set $JAVA_OPTS accordingly in your environment.

IMPORTANT: 
Using jboss-cli for deployment adds the deployment to the respective configuration file (e.g. standalone-full.xml), so
this method is NOT suited for our needs. But there is another way: We should use drop-in deployment and monitor the marker files.
Just look at the build.gradle in the companion project

Branches
========

The project has 3 branches:
master: standard with the demo H2 database
ssl_branch: configured with SSL activated and keystore
postgres_branch: configured with postgres-jdbc driver and datasource
